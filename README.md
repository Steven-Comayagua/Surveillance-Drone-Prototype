## Part 1: Image classification 

- [ ] Setup the Nvidia Jetson Xavier.
- [ ] Connect the Intel Real Sense.
- [ ] Publish the live output of the main and depth camera.
- [ ] Implement a mobile version of an image classification model (YOLO 8 for instance), which would be the most advanced one that works the best on the hardware.
- [ ] Provide the CPU usage (you need to have some CPU capacity left for later specific calculations).
