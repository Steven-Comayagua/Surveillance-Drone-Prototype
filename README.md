### Calibrating SIK Telemetry Radio

We are using a SIK Telemetry Radio v3 connected to the TELEM1 port on the Pixhawk 6x. This needs to be calibrated on ArduPilot before any flight.

1. **Connect the SIK Telemetry Radio**: Plug the SIK telemetry radio into the TELEM1 port on the Pixhawk 6x.
2. **Configure the Radio in Mission Planner**:
    - Open Mission Planner.
    - Navigate to `Initial Setup` > `Optional Hardware` > `SiK Radio`.
    - Follow the instructions to set the correct parameters for the telemetry radio.
3. **Calibrate the Radio**: Ensure the telemetry radios on both the ground and air units are communicating correctly.

#### Optional - Joystick Manual Test Flight

We used ArduPilot to manually fly our drone with an RC (PS4 controller in our case with the joystick option within ArduPilot). 
The radio controller setting RC option is also the best and favored option, but at this moment, our selected receiver (AR410) isn't working correctly with our Pixhawk 6x.

1. Configure all the needed joystick direction flight options, making sure to have an ARM and DISARM button.
2. Follow the steps online for detailed instructions on how to set up and configure the manual test flight.
3. Keep in mind, the manual flight is not using any sensors, so the flight of the drone will be hard to control.

</p>


For manual flight using the RC (Radio Control) system, here are the steps:

1. **Connecting the Receiver**:
   - Connect the R86C receiver to the Pixhawk 6x through the `RC-IN` pins.
   - Ensure the ground (black), power (red), and signal (usually white or orange) wires are properly connected to the corresponding RC pins on the Pixhawk.

2. **Binding the TX12 MK2 with the R86C Receiver**:
   - **Set the TX12 MK2 to Bind Mode**:
     - Power on the Radiomaster TX12 MK2.
     - Access the Model Setup page by long-pressing the `SYS` button.
     - Navigate to the `Internal RF` settings and set the `Mode` to `MULTI`, the `Type` to `FrSky X`, and the `Subtype` to `D16`.
     - Scroll down and select the `Bind` option.
   **Bind the R86C Receiver**:
     - Power on the R86C receiver while holding the bind button until the LED indicates it is in binding mode (typically solid or fast blinking).
     - The R86C receiver cycles through different protocols indicated by different LED flash patterns. Ensure it is in the correct mode for your transmitter (FrSky D16).
     - Once bound, the LED on the receiver should change to a solid color or a slow blink indicating a successful bind.
     - Power the receiver off and then on again to confirm the binding.
     - Exit bind mode on the TX12 MK2 and ensure the receiver LED remains in the bound state.

3. **Setting Up RC**:
   - Ensure the Radiomaster TX12 MK2 and R86C receiver are properly bound.
   - Verify the transmitter settings, ensuring channels are correctly mapped and configured.

4. **Calibrating the Controls**:
   - Use ArduPilot Mission Planner or QGroundControl to calibrate your transmitter.
   - Navigate to the `Radio Calibration` section under `Initial Setup` (Mission Planner) or the `Radio` tab under `Vehicle Setup` (QGroundControl).
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to move the sticks and switches on your transmitter to their extremes to calibrate the radio input.

5. **Configuring Safety Features**:
   - Ensure you have ARM and DISARM buttons configured on your transmitter.
   - Set up failsafe options to handle the loss of RC signal. This can be done in the `Failsafe` settings within Mission Planner or QGroundControl.
   - Verify that failsafe actions are correctly configured to ensure the safety of the vehicle in case of signal loss.

### Testing the GPS Signal

We are using an M8N GPS module connected to the GPS1 port on the Pixhawk 6x.

1. **Connect the GPS Module**: Attach the M8N GPS module to the GPS1 port on the Pixhawk 6x.
2. **Power On the System**: Ensure the drone's power system is correctly connected and power on the system.
3. **Open Mission Planner**: Launch Mission Planner on your computer.
4. **Check GPS Status**: Navigate to the Flight Data screen and check the GPS status


### Test - Arm the drone.

1. Without the blades attached to the motors, power on the drone and ensure all systems are functioning.
2. Test the ARM button: Press the ARM button and verify that the motors begin to spin.
3. Test the DISARM button: Press the DISARM button and ensure that the motors stop spinning.
4. Test the KILL switch: Press the KILL switch to confirm it immediately stops the motors in case of an emergency.

Ensure all these safety features are working correctly before proceeding to attach the blades or perform any flight tests.
