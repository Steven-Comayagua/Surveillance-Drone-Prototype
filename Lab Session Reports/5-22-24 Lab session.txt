Continuing from the previous session, we had multiple attemps to boot the Jetson Xavier NX with an SD Card Image.
I also failed to mentioned that the OS that we using to format our microSD card is Windows.
At every attempt, the Jetson Xavier NX would not boot up or display anything to the monitor.
The team tried multiple time reformatting the micro SD card, these were the steps that we followed:
- Reformat the microSD card using the application from this website: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/sd-memory-card-formatter-for-windows-download/
- On the SD Card Formatter, on "select card" we would select the drive that had our microSD. In our case, the drive was named "D:\".
- For "Formatting options", we selected "Quick Format". And as instructed, we left "volume label" blank. After that we clicked "Format".
