Continuing from the previous session, we had multiple attempts to boot the Jetson Xavier NX with an SD Card Image.
I also failed to mention that the OS that we use to format our microSD card is Windows.
At every attempt, the Jetson Xavier NX would not boot up or display anything on a computer monitor.
The team tried multiple times to reformatting the micro SD card, these were the steps that we followed:
- Reformat the microSD card using the application from this website: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/sd-memory-card-formatter-for-windows-download/
- On the SD Card Formatter, on "select card" we would select the drive that had our microSD. In our case, the drive was named "D:\".
- For "Formatting options", we selected "Quick Format". As instructed, we left "volume label" blank. After that, we clicked "Format".
