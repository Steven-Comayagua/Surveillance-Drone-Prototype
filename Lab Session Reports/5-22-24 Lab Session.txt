Continuing from the previous session, we had multiple attempts to boot the Jetson Xavier NX with an SD Card Image.
I also failed to mention that the OS that we use to format our microSD card is Windows.
At every attempt, the Jetson Xavier NX would not boot up or display anything on a computer monitor.
The team tried multiple times to reformatting the micro SD card, these were the steps that we followed:
*If Windows sends a message to reformat the disk in your drive, ignore it and click on "cancel"*
- Reformat the microSD card using the application from this website: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/sd-memory-card-formatter-for-windows-download/
- On the SD Card Formatter, on "select card" we would select the drive that had our microSD. In our case, the drive was named "D:\".
- For "Formatting options", we selected "Quick Format". As instructed, we left "volume label" blank. After that, we clicked "Format".
To flash the SD Card Image to our microSD card, we used Etcher.
This is the link to download Etcher: https://etcher.balena.io/
This is the link to download the SD Card Image: https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack-sdk-513
*We are using JetPack 5.1.3 because it is the latest version that still supports the Jetson Xavier NX.*
On the Etcher application, we selected "Flash from File"
Select the SD Card Image zip file, it is named "JP513-xnx-sd-card-image".
After selecting the zip file we clicked "Flash!". It approximately took 20 minutes for our microSD card to be flashed every time we repeated this process.
Once the microSD is flashed, we connected it to the Jetson Xavier NX and hoped it booted up.
Our lab session ends with the team not being able to boot up the Jetson Xavier NX.
